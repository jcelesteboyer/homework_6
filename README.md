### What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. This is based on a model by E. F. Codd. This is a database that houses tables of data that contain rows and columns of information. The data points are connected to one another (aka relational). SQL stands for Structured Query Langauage. It is a programming language that is used to extracting and organizing data that can then be used for analysis.
